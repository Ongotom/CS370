# CS370

•	Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
I was given the framework for the maze, the library references, the actions sets for the model, as well as the execution of the action program. A neural network was provided and I then help set the deep Q-learning.  I set the various states of the model and maze so that everything the model learned, it used in its’ next run to try and solve the maze.
•	Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
o	What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
	Computer scientist are continually teaching AI how to learn faster and with accuracy that is human helpful and ethical.
o	How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
	I think about how I would solve it. I program my model to solve it as blindly as possible and t hen I marry the results. DO I align my thinking more to how the model figured it out or do I need to give the model more instructions?
o	What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
	My responsibilities are that the data is correct and unbiased. The model runs correctly and error free and can be validated and reproduced. I need human review to ensure that data represents real life and I set guard rails to ensure that models do not act unexpectedly.
